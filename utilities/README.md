# General Utilities

This directory holds general utilities for working with ADCIRC netCDF files, formatted for compatibility with the POSIX shell standard.

- `netcdf_header_info.sh`: Shell script to pull specific information from the header of a NetCDF output file generated by ADCIRC through the 
ASGS and copy it to a text file which will be read by a ParaView Python script to create an annotation. See the script's comment header for more details.
    - Usage example: `netcdf_header_info.sh fort.63.nc` creates the file `label_info.txt` in the same directory as `fort.63.nc`.
- `netcdf_timeslice_dap.sh`: Shell script to download a subset (subset meaning only pulling data corresponding to a given number of time values) of a NetCDF file using OPeNDAP with the NCO ncks utility.
    - Usage example: `netcdf_timeslice_dap.sh http://fortytwo.cct.lsu.edu/thredds/dodsC/2020/al13/27/CTXCS2017/qbc.loni.org/CTXCS2017_al132020_jgf/nhcConsensus/fort.63.nc 9`
      to download a subset of the requested fort.63.nc with data for times 0 to 9.
