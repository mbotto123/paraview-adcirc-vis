# Color maps for ADCIRC visualization
This directory contains color maps necessary to run the scripts in the repository.

- The bathymetry/topography color maps (`blueBrownGreenBathyTopoColorMap.xml` and `blueGreenBathyTopoColorMap.xml`) were made by Dr. Jason Fleming (Seahorse Coastal Consulting, https://github.com/jasonfleming).

- `RdYlBu_Brewer.xml` is a red-yellow-blue diverging color map for water surface elevation made using the ColorBrewer website (www.ColorBrewer.org by Dr. Cynthia A. Brewer, Geography, Pennsylvania State University). To see the color map in ColorBrewer, you can follow this link: https://colorbrewer2.org/?type=diverging&scheme=RdYlBu&n=11
